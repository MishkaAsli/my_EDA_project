Question/Need:
The purpose of the model we are trying to build is to optimize the placement of the street teams near subways to maximize the amount of signatures for the women in technology gala. The beneficiary of exploring this question will be the gala organizers. 

Data Description:
The datasets used will be the MTA turnstile data and the Census. The MTA turnstile data will be used to examine where there is the highest foot traffic and therefore the highest potential for signatures. The Census will be used to examine where there is a large woman and young adult population in NY. I will obtain both datasets from the internet or where ever else is it publicly available. The unit of analysis in this project is each train station. The features I expect to work with are foot traffic in a station and demographic in an area. My target is the areas with the highest foot traffic of primarily women/young adults. This will provide the most amount of signatures of people who are interested in women in technology and building awareness and reach. 

Tools:
I plan to meet the tools requirements of the project by downloading all necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib) and using SQL and Python. I don't plan on needing any additional tools beyond those required.

MVP Goal:
The MVP for this project would be to look at the turnstile data and movement for one train station on one day.
