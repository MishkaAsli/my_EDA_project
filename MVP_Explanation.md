The goal of this project is to place gala employees at specific train station exits to optimize and maximize the number of signatures and attendees they receive.

This scatter plot shows the 20 train stations with the total exits slightly above the median exits.

I came to this conclusion after removing all negative daily differences, any differences larger than 100,000 and any rows with DESC == RECOVR AUD.

My next goals are to see specifically the top bank of turnstiles within these ~20 train stations to confirm which train station exits the gala employees 
should stand outside of to maxmize signatures. I would also like to gather census data to understand where primarily women and young adults live to also
optimize the employees locations.
